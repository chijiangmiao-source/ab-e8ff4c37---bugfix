"""Saga engine for a multi-valve switch.

Rules implemented here:

* Valves move in the request order; the FIRST failing forward action stops
  the forward pass.
* Already changed valves are compensated in the REVERSE of the order they
  succeeded in.
* ``COMPENSATED`` is reported only when every restoration succeeds.
* A failed compensation leaves the switch in the explicit, resumable phase
  ``COMPENSATION_FAILED`` with per-valve status showing exactly what remains.
* Every step is driven from durable state, so a process restart resumes an
  interrupted switch: a device action already committed (but whose receipt
  was never stored) is recognized through the device's
  ``(operation_id, phase)`` dedupe and never applied twice.
* Re-submitting an existing operation_id returns the same stored result; a
  re-submission with a different payload is rejected (409) and never touches
  a device.
* An operation that has not reached a final phase keeps ownership of its
  valves: a NEW operation_id naming any of those valves is rejected (409)
  before anything is registered and before any device is touched.  Without
  this, a follow-up switch could complete over valves that the unfinished
  operation later restores to their initial openings, leaving the field
  state, the stored phase and the per-valve results in contradiction.
